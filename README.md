## Bug notice

Due to the way Striver's website is made, the contents are rendered after the page is loaded.
Because of this behaviour, the extension doesn't load automatically on webpage load.

The extension popup needs to be opened for the update to take place.

This can be fixed if a background service enables the extension after some seconds once webpage is loaded or checking if the content has been added to the page.

This will be fixed in later updates, thanks for using this extension!
